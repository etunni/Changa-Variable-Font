# Changa

![](CHANGA-cover.jpg)

Changa is a typeface family intended for headlines, titles and other display settings and supports the Latin and Arabic scripts.

The Latin was developed with a singular height so that you can create display texts with minimum line spacing. The lowercase has short ascenders and descenders and the letters are inscribed within a square. The uppercase is also sturdy and squat. The counter shapes are rectangular, featuring small curves in opposite vertexes which accompany and break the shapes, evoking a contemporary style. Now redesigned with the advantages of variable font technology.
